## Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project is configured for easy deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

To deploy your application, follow these steps:

1.  **Push your code** to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository.
2.  In your repository, go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
3.  Under the "Build and deployment" section, select **GitHub Actions** as the source.
4.  The GitHub Actions workflow included in this repository (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) will automatically build and deploy your site.
5.  Once the action completes, your site will be live at the URL provided in the Pages settings (e.g., `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/`).

The site will automatically redeploy every time you push a change to the `main` branch.
